Project 1: For my project on Global Development Indicators, I conducted an exploratory analysis using data from the World Bank Development Indicators service. I focused on examining relationships between key variables such as GDP, literacy rates, life expectancy, and internet access to understand global development trends. Using the tidyverse package, I loaded and cleaned the dataset, ensuring it was well-structured for analysis. To visualize these trends effectively, I created pie charts and bar graphs. The pie chart was used to represent the distribution of a specific development indicator across different regions, providing a clear comparison of proportions. The bar graph was utilized to highlight differences in key indicators over time or across various countries. To enhance the readability of my visualizations, I customized the plots by applying appropriate themes, labels, and color schemes. These visualizations helped illustrate crucial insights, such as the disparities in internet access and literacy rates across regions or the correlation between GDP and life expectancy. Through this analysis, I was able to uncover significant trends that shed light on the progress and challenges of global development.

Project 2: For my project on Olympic Games Performance Analysis, I conducted an in-depth investigation of trends in Olympic performance by country, sport, and gender using a dataset covering all athletes, medallists, hosts, and results from 1906 to 2022. Using the tidyverse package, I loaded and cleaned the data to ensure consistency and accuracy for analysis. To effectively visualize key trends, I created pie charts and bar graphs. The pie chart was used to illustrate the distribution of medals among top-performing countries, providing insight into which nations have historically dominated the Olympics. The bar graph highlighted changes in athlete participation and medal distribution over time, revealing patterns such as the increasing representation of female athletes and shifts in dominant sports. To enhance readability, I customized the visualizations with appropriate themes, labels, and color schemes. These visualizations helped uncover significant trends, such as the impact of hosting the Olympics on a countryâ€™s medal count and how participation by gender has evolved over the years, providing a comprehensive understanding of factors influencing Olympic performance.
