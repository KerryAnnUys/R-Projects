Project 1: The objective of this project is to conduct an exploratory analysis of global development indicators. The analysis focuses on examining the relationships between key variables such as GDP, literacy rates, life expectancy, and internet access, along with other relevant indicators of global development. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the World Bank Development Indicators service, covering data from 1984 to 2021 for 48 countries. By exploring these variables, the project aims to uncover trends and insights that can inform our understanding of global development, as well as how these indicators interact and affect one another over time.

Project 2: This project investigates trends in Olympic performance, with a particular focus on performance trends by country, sport, or gender. The goal is to track how these trends have evolved over time, using data spanning from 1906 to 2022. The analysis includes creating visualizations such as a line graph and two pie charts to better understand the distribution and changes in Olympic performance. Additionally, the project aims to discuss the factors influencing Olympic performance, including how variables like country, gender, and sport might impact the success of athletes and countries in the Games. The dataset for this analysis includes data on athletes, medallists, hosts, and results from past Olympic Games, providing a comprehensive view of the Games' history and performance trends.
